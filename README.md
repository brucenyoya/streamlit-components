# Streamlit Components

Components are third-party Python modules that extend what's possible with Streamlit [[1](https://docs.streamlit.io/library/components)].

## What Streamlit components are available?

There are several dozens of Streamlit components featured on Streamlit's website [2](https://streamlit.io/components).

Fanilo provided an amazing list of Streamlit components on the wiki post [3] that lists about 85 Streamlit components as of April 2022.

## How to use?

Streamlit components are just a pip-install away.

In this tutorial, let's get you started in using the `streamlit_pandas_profiling` component [4](https://share.streamlit.io/okld/streamlit-gallery/main?p=pandas-profiling).

#### Install the component 

```bash
pip install streamlit_pandas_profiling
```


## Demo app

## Code
Here's how to use st.write:
```python
import streamlit as st


```

## Line-by-line explanation

```
